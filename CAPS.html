            <h2>CAPS</h2>
            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and connect meaningfully with others.
                UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For information about UHS, please visit the <a href="https://uhs.umich.edu/">UHS Website.</a></p>

            <p>Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer students a place to vent.</p>
